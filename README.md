# Unity-Class-Certificate-Work
All Unity work done for XR (VR / AR) NYU Tandon Certificate

The following repository contains all the .zip midterm and capstone projects that have been constructed over the period of the Unity Immersive Design Certificate course.
Certificate is valid and issued as of December 14th 2021 and all the projects here are the result of work done to prove proficiency in Mixed Reality work.

For the Virtual Reality (VR) files, you can test them on an Oculus Quest / Oculus Quest 2 / Any Android Device or you can simply run the project in Unity itself.
For the Augmented Reality (AR) files, you can test them on any IOS Device or you can simply run the project in Unity itself.

All projects necessitate Unity Version 2019.4.* to run (suggested is 2019.4.17f1)

The Virtual Reality (VR) project showcases a construction site tour with active animations, interactable / grabbable objects, sound design, lighting, post-processing work, 
custom 3D models, imported assets, and many more to VR experience.

The Augmented Reality (AR) project showcases an aircraft industrial showcase with ProBuilds / PolyBrush / ProGrids built models, animations, lighting, post-processing work,
use of plane detection, use of occlusion, and many more that contribute to AR experience.
